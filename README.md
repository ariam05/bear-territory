A new way for incoming UC Berkeley students who have never visited the campus to find their perfect study spot immediately!

UC Berkeley admits over 14,000 students with many of them having almost no knowledge about the campus. One major problem that this community faces is the diculty of initially finding good study spots that allowed them to study to their best ability. While there exist library websites, many only provide basic information such as hours and address and as a new student, it can be quite frustrating navigating to these study spots.

By providing up-to-date and detailed information about places to study on and off campus (such as hours, food options, and more), the application eases the process of finding study locations. No longer will you have no idea where to go if your favorite library is full!

The home page of my app is divided into two vertical halves. The top half has an interactive map that pins placed on the locations of nearby libraries.

The bottom half contains a list of react components where each component represents a specific study location. You can click on the arrow to the right of the component to view detailed information about the location.

This information contains the locationâ€™s description, weekly hours, and amenities. You also have the option to "heart" your favorite study location to add to your favorites list.
